<h1>Lophotrochozoa</h1>

<div class="half">
<h2 class="pink">Mollusca</h2>
<p>a great phylum by number of species and by variety of body forms; largely aquatic. Hugely important fossil record from the Lower Cambrian. A major food source for mankind, second only to fish. United by their mantle, the muscular 'foot', the radula (teeth band), and (ancestrally) by the shell. Number of living species estimated as 50,000 to 150,000. Classes: lesser classes are the Aplacophora, Monoplacophora, and Polyplacophora. Major classes are the Gastropods, Cephalopods, Bivalves and Scaphopods.</p>

<div  class="half">
<h2 class="red">Platyhelminthes</h2>
<p>the flatworms. Classes: Turbellaria: free-living and aquatic (4,500 species); Trematoda: parasitic flukes of molluscs and vertebrates (~1500 species); Cestoda: tapeworms, parasitic in the digestive tract of vertebrates (3400 species); Monogenea: ectoparasites on the gills and skin of fish (1100 species). Muller's larva is characteristic of the free-living species, but in the parasitic groups development may be direct.<p/>

<div  class="whole">
<h2 class="yellow">Brachiopoda</h2>
<p> the lamp-shells, with a huge fossil record going back to the Cambrian. 12,000 species, of which 350 are still living (or 100 according to Clarkson).[7]p158 They look rather like bivalves, and they do have an upper and lower part to the shell. However, their internal organisation is quite different.[2][8]p395 They were the dominant inshore fauna (infauna) of the Palaeozoic, but were much reduced by the two main extinction events, the P/Tr and K/T. Bivalve molluscs took over their inshore habitats in the Mesozoic, and since then the brachiopods have been confined to deeper water, except for a handful of species.</p>
